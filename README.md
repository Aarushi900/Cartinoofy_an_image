# Cartinoofy_an_image
Cartoonify an image using Python
PROBLEM STATEMENT - Cartoonifying an Image

In this project, we have built an application to upload the image on the app. To convert an image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are done. Firstly, an image is converted to a Grayscale image. Then, the Grayscale image is smoothened, and we try to extract the edges in the image. Finally, we form a color image and mask it with edges. This creates a beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened color of the original image.

We have used the following python libraries:

OpenCv
easygui
Numpy
imageio
Matplotlib
os
tkinter
sys
PIL
